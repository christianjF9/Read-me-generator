  To add a screenshot, create an folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

      function renderLicenseSection(license) {
  return `  ## License 

  ${renderLicenseLink}
  The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
